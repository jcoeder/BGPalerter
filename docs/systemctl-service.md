If you are interested in running this application as a service on a Linux server here is a basic guide as to how to do that.

If this is a new installation create a directory to place the application files.

`mkdir /opt/bgpalerter`

This is the directory where the binary and yaml config files will be stored.  The application will also create `logs` and `src` subdirectories here
